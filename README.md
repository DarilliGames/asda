Aikido Derby website- The Milestone Project by Stan Kaczorkiewicz

This is my first project on the course of Full Stack Web Developer by Code Institute. 
My aim was to create a responsive, mobile-first website, using the HTML and CSS that I have learned on the course.
The project doesn't include any back-end functionality, 
so the form on my "contact" section will not send attached information anywhere (yet).


I've decided to create the website for my Aikido Derby Club. 
We had the website previously (http://aikidoderby.co.uk/), but it's not responsive, 
looks very outdated and doesn't work right now. 
The main aim of the website is to encourage more people to join our club,
diversify our member profile by inviting more female students (as currently we only have one) 
and kids (as we are planning to start a kids-only class soon).


UX

My goal was to create good user-friendly experience, for people that don't know anything about Aikido yet,
But potentially would like to come and try, for example as a result of their New Year resolutions.
To ensure that my website is intuitive, I used Bootstrap's ready solutions for the website navigation.
Our club does not have any professional logo yet, so I thought that putting our name in top-left corner is a good idea, 
to remaind users where they actually are.

I've decided to divide my website into 5 separate pages (one or two more to come if it will be neccessery),
as I belive it will be easier for the users not to get lost between the informations and pictures,
as it could happen on one long scrolling site. After all, the website is for newbies and I don't want to overwhelm them.
Also this solution provides 5 chances to find our Facebook or Instagram account links that are located in the footer.
To make the links to our social media more visually attractive, I used icons taken from https://fontawesome.com/ 

As the best source of information about our Club is the Facebook page, regularly updated by our sensei,
across whole page I've located quite a few ways to make it easy for user, to get there.
Althought if the users do not have a Facebook account for any reason, 
they can still find all neccesssery informations about our classes, location and costs.
Also that's why I left our sensei's number in the footer,
if anyone has got a questions that our website are not answering yet.


Features:

On the home page, I've decided to use the picture of Sensei in-motion, 
presenting one of the more advanced techniques 
and turn it into animation, to draw more attention of the visitors.
Underneath we've got some text-description of what aikido is, 
based on the article from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido), section "training".
As it's extremly hard to work with kids in a pre-school age, I've highlighted note about minimum age,
among with information that we are open to all adults that want to join us.

The beginners zone contains the quote from https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/384630-aikido-ain-t-a-defensive-nor-offensive-martial-art-it-proactively
then another animated picture of sensei presenting more static technique, 
as I'm trying not to scare the beginners with difficulty of aikido techniques.
Another reason for choosing that picture was the only girl in our club, that is present there- 
to prove our opennes and to encourage more women to join us 
(for some reason Martial Arts are considered as very masculine, that is not the true if we speak about Aikido).
Under the picture, there are most important details for the new members- how to get here,
When do we train and how much does it costs.
I've also left the note of how to dress, as it may not be obvious.
Our address and time are highlighted, 
as that's the most important info on whole website and main reason for people to visit it.

The gallery page is based on the modals, provided by Bootstrap. 
All the pictures are either made by myself, or other members of our club and then presented on our Facebook profile.
Users that are parents, can find pictures of other kids on some of the photos, 
so it may make them happy to send their kids for the class as well.
All users can see examples of various techniques, 
hopefully attractive enough to interest more people to come and try.
I've got more of the pictures and some videos to be attached here, but I'm not sure if it won't slow my website down,
making it less-pleasant for the users to interact with.


"About" section provides the picture of the founder of Aikido with some brief informations about history of Aikido 
(based on wikipedia page again),
Under that we can find some history of our club (taken from our Facebook description, 
without unnecessary bits, that are huge part of it down there- 
I was implementig the Idea of not overloading my website with unneeded content).

"Contact" section contain short remainder of most important informations, among with the form 
(that is not fully functional yet), if someone shy to call sensei or text him on Facebook.


Features:

    Existing features:
    -gallery with the modals, hopefully more attractive than other ways;
    -responsive design, that works and looks good on all various types of the equipment;
    -fully functional nav panel, that adjust to the size of the screen;


    Features Left to Implement:
    -form from the contact page to send the messages straight to the sensei;
    -some slow-motion videos to be embedded to the gallery page;
    -as we've got the Club T-shirts, it could be good idea to provide option of buying them through our website,
     (after I learn how to make it), as it will benefit the club.


Technologies Used:

    -HTML5 -            I used it to create the core of my website;

    -CSS3 -             I used it to style it;

    -GitHub -           Provides me the enviroment to work within;

    - Bootstrap 4.4 -   I used it to provide responsive Navigation and the Gallery page;

    - Fontawesome -     They provide the icons for the links in footer section on each page, 
                        also the "smiling faces" icon that I used in two other places across the page comes from there;

   -JQuery -            That was used as a part of the bootstrap, to help with responsivness of my nav-bar;


Testing

    During the proccess of creation of my first website, I was constantly testing it's functionality.
    My main worry in this subject was to make it responsive, as many users may visit it through their phones.
