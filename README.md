Aikido Derby website- The Milestone Project by Stan Kaczorkiewicz

This is my first project on the course of Full Stack Web Developer by Code Institute. 
My aim was to create a responsive, mobile-first website, using the HTML and CSS that I have learned on the course.
The project doesn't include any back-end functionality, 
so the form on my "contact" section will not send attached information anywhere (yet).


I've decided to create the website for my Aikido Derby Club. 
We had the website previously (http://aikidoderby.co.uk/), but it's not responsive, 
looks very outdated and doesn't work right now. 
The main aim of the website is to encourage more people to join our club,
diversify our member profile by inviting more female students (as currently we only have one) 
and kids (as we are planning to start a kids-only class soon).


UX

My goal was to create good user-friendly experience, for people that don't know anything about Aikido yet,
But potentially would like to come and try, for example as a result of their New Year resolutions.
To ensure that my website is intuitive, I used Bootstrap's ready solutions for the website navigation.
Our club does not have any professional logo yet, so I thought that putting our name in top-left corner is a good idea, 
To remaind users where they actually are.

I've decided to divide my website into 5 separate pages (one or two more to come if it will be neccessery),
as I belive it will be easier for the users not to get lost between the informations and pictures,
as it could happen on one long scrolling site. After all, the website is for newbies and I don't want to overwhelm them.
Also this solution provides 5 chances to find our Facebook or Instagram account links that are located in the footer.
To make the links to our social media more visually attractive, I used icons taken from https://fontawesome.com/ 

As the best source of information about our Club is the Facebook page, regularly updated by our sensei,
Across whole page I've located quite a few ways to make it easy for user, to get there.
Althought if the users do not have a Facebook account for any reason, 
they can still find all neccesssery informations about our classes, location and costs.
Also that's why I left our sensei's number in the footer,
if anyone has got a questions that our website are not answering yet.


Features:

On the home page, I've decided to use the picture of Sensei in-motion, 
presenting one of the more advanced techniques 
and turn it into animation, to draw more attention of the visitors.
Underneath we've got some text-description of what aikido is, 
based on the article from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido), section "training".
As it's extremly hard to work with kids in a pre-school age, I've highlighted note about minimum age,
Among with information that we are open to all adults that want to join us.


The gallery page is also based on the modals, provided by Bootstrap.
